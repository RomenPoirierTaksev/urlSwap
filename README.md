# urlSwap
Swap a Spotify song URL to an Apple Music song URL, or vice versa.
I made this because i got tired of not being able to listen to songs my friends would send me through Apple Music.
Gonna make a front-end soon, but basically just enter the URLs into swap.py and run it.

You'll have to have requests installed.
